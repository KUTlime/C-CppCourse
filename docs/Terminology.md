# C++ Terminology

> Basic C++ terminology.

## Class

A user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.

- **Instance** – An object created from a class.
- **Method** – A member function of a class.
- **Member** – A variable or function that belongs to a class.
- **Data member** – A member variable that holds data within a class (also called a property).
- **Constructor** – A special member function that is called when an object is created; used to initialize the object.
- **Destructor** – A special member function that is called when an object is destroyed; used to clean up resources.

## Other Basic Terminology

- **Object** – An instance of a class.
- **Inheritance** – The mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
- **Encapsulation** – The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- **Polymorphism** – The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically via virtual functions.
- **Abstraction** – The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- **Access specifiers** – Keywords that define the accessibility of class members: `public`, `protected`, and `private`.
- **Namespace** – A declarative region that provides a scope to identifiers (such as variables, types, functions) to avoid name conflicts.
- **Pointer** – A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- **Reference** – An alias for another variable.
